User Inputs: 

Wheel Diameter
Revolutions Per Minute (RPM)
Target Distance - Assume KM

Processing:
Distance / ((pi * Diameter) / 60) * RPM) = Time

Output: Time 
IF Diameter is provided in metres, result = Time in seconds to travel the distance
Time needs to be in milliseconds though!


Say 
Diameter = 1
Distance = 1 
RPM = 1

Pi / 60 = 0.0524
0.0524 x rpm = 0.0524
1 / 0.05235987755983 = 19.09859317â€¦


RPM
Distance
Diameter = time
